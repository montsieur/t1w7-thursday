# Advanced Data Types

## Lists
 - They are ordered, mutable (changable, can add, replace or remove) collections of items. 
 - They are defined by enclosing elements in square brackets.
 - e.g: fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", 1]

 ## Tuples
 - They are ordered, immutable (unchangable, cannot replace, add or remove) collections of items.
 - They are defined by enclosing elemtns in parenthesis/small brackets ()

## Sets
- They are unordered collection of unique elements (cannot have identical elements).
- They are useful for membership testing, removing duplicates from a sequence, and mathematical operations like union, interesections and difference.
- Cannot access elements using index operator []. Need to check if the elements exist in the set.
- They are defined by enclosing elements in curly brackets {}.
